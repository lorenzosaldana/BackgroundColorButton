# BackgroundColorButton
A button in the chart that you can click to change the color of the background. 
Gives one access to a quick and easy way to change the background color. Useful when monitoring multiple charts at one time to designate which charts should be the point of focus.
# How To Use:
1. Add the BackgroundColorButton.ex4 file to your MT4's Indicator folder.
2. Refresh the navigator window or restart your MT4 program.
3. From the navigator window drag and drop "BackgroundColorButton" to your desired chart.

***The default setting for this button indicator is set to black for on and white for off, but you can edit the code by opening BackgroundColorButton.mq4 to fit your needs.***
